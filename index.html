<p class="Group, TabTwo" style="color:white">When testing out the game there still seems to be a bit of a glitch when it comes to the jumping mechanic. I was able to observe that at certain points players were able to add another jump mid air depending on the direction they were looking at. Me and my partner agreed that a single jump would be more challenging but understandably difficult for players.

As previously stated, the game does seem to have a positive response to it. However, there are still aspects of the game that can be fixed or in a sense enhanced. I would like to specifically work on the assets for the main character can be created with a bit more detail. The movement of the player seems to work with the players, the little aspect of floating does give the understanding of the movement a reason why it makes the game challenging. The game is planned to be continued on with polishing. Even with the positive outcome of the game, there is still things that can be improved.
